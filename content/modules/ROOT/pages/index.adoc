# Fast, Cheap, and Accurate: Optimizing LLM Inference with vLLM and Quantization

Welcome to this hands-on workshop for DeveloperWeek 2026. During our time, you'll learn practical techniques for deploying high-performance language models in production environments.

## The Challenge

Large language models are powerful, but expensive to run:
* High memory requirements
* Slow inference speeds limiting throughput
* GPU costs that increase with demand

Production deployments need a different approach than research environments.

## What You'll Learn

This workshop demonstrates how to optimize LLM inference using two key technologies:

**vLLM** - A high-performance inference engine that:

* Uses paged attention for efficient memory management
* Implements continuous batching for higher throughput
* Provides an OpenAI-compatible API for easy integration

**Quantization** - 8-bit integer weights and activations that:

* Reduce memory footprint by ~50-60%
* Improve throughput by 1.5-2x
* Maintain accuracy within 3-8% of full precision

You'll deploy a quantized model, benchmark its performance, and measure accuracy trade-offs—all with hands-on command-line tools.

## Workshop Modules

Use the navigation menu to follow along:

**Module 1: Environment Setup and Interactive Chat**
Build a streaming chat client that connects to a vLLM server running a quantized Gemma model. Monitor GPU utilization and understand OpenAI-compatible APIs.

**Module 2: Benchmarking with GuideLLM**
Measure throughput, latency, and saturation points under production-like loads. Use the LLM itself to interpret benchmark results.

**Module 3: Measuring Model Accuracy**
Evaluate reasoning capability using the ARC-Easy dataset. Quantify how much accuracy you're trading for performance gains.

## Prerequisites

You'll need:

* Access to the provided workshop lab environment (GPU-enabled)
* Basic familiarity with command-line tools
* Python knowledge helpful but not required

All code examples are provided—just copy, paste, and run.
